# League of Legends Dodge Simulator

I created this project using C++ and SFML, as a starter project to get me more familiar with the library. The game features many enemy projectiles that you have to dodge, enemies that you must shoot, the ability to flash as well as stop in place, score tracking and resetting weapon cooldowns upon enemy kills. Although the graphics are crude, it does serve very well as a practice tool for aiming and movement that emulates the gameplay in LoL, and it is comparable to the experience on loldodgegame.
